There are lots of sights to see in Paris. The Eiffel Tower and La Louvre are must see sights, 
but here are some uncommon things to do in Paris!

<h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine">La Seine</a></h4>

The Seine is one of the main attractions of Paris. You will see daily river cruises that take you around
all of Paris along the water. However, there are some things to do in Paris along the Seine that 
not many people know about. At sunset, there are lots of dancing parties. No, I don't mean clubbing or
actual partying, I mean <em> dancing </em> parties. If you see a couple start to do the tango along
the water, feel free to <em> join in</em>! Tango parties on the Seine are the thing to do here at sunset 
and it's a romantic night out for free!

<h4><a href="https://www.operadeparis.fr/en/visits/palais-garnier">Academie Nationale de Musique</a></h4>
Known as Palais Garnier or simply the Paris Opera, this is a beautiful building. The exterior hails back 
to an architectural design of the 1800s. Come here to discover the theater of Paris and take in the marvelous
design of the exterior and interior. Tickets should be purchased in advance as the shows can be sold out!

<h4><a href="https://www.gardenvisit.com/gardens/jardin_du_luxembourg/">Jardin Du Luxembourg</a></h4>

Luxembourg Gardens is actually a main attraction. Tourists like to come here, but I think this is a 
must see destination in Paris. These gardens are beautiful! Come on a sunny day and sit on one of the
chairs surrounding the central fountain to people watch. You can bring a little toy boat and sail it around
the fountain! Children and adults love this favorite pasttime.
