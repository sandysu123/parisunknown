<h4><a href="www.vaux-le-vicomte.com/en/">Chateau De Vaux-Le-Vicomte</a></h4>
This chateau was created in the 1600s and emanates the Louis XIV designs of the time of grand classicism 
and open concepts. You will see these influences everywhere in Paris today. Despite the beautiful chateau, which
most people are familar with, the gardens are the real gem. The gardens were redesigned by Louis XIV's royal
gardener and landscaper, Nicolas Fouquet. He created a beautiful design with open space, strong lines, and 
many fountains! It's a great place to explore!

<h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChÃ¢teau_Rothschild">The Chateau Rothschild</a></h4>
This is an abandoned mansion from the famous Rothschild family built in the 1800s. It was taken over
by the Nazis in World War II and now, it is a crumbling estate that is covered in graffiti. All is not lost
as this is a place of discovery. The gardens are now a public park and you can enjoy a whimsical afternoon
picnic lunch with the view of the old chateau. However, going inside the mansion is not allowed, as the 
roof is collapsing and unstable.

<h4><a href="https://www.labourdaisiere.com/">Chateau de la Bourdaisiere</a></h4>

This chateau is what you would envision in a fairytale. A beautiful castle-like building with spires and
large windows. They have a beautiful garden that is reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland! Delicate flowers
sprawl the entire estate. You can have a lovely lunch in their delicious tomato bar, where they serve French culinary 
dishes made of their garden tomatoes. This is truly a treat. The chateau also serves as a hotel, so if you
would like to spend the night in a castle, this is the chance! Don't forget to wake up to their wonderful
breakfast!
