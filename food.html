<h4><a href="http://www.creperiesuzette.fr/">Crepe Suzette</a></h4>

Crepe Suzette has so many crepes for 6-12 euros. There are the simple 
butter crepes and the extra fancy ham, cheese, and egg crepes. This is 
definitely a spot you check out when you are hungry. Come with a small group
so that you can sample all the crepes from everyone's plate!

<h4><a href="http://www.lespetitesbouchees.com/">Les Petites Bouchees</a></h4>
A cute little dinner spot in Les Marais. Food is served in petite plates and are surprisingly
affordable for this trendy neighborhood. Located in a quiet street, this bistro
is great for a simple, affordable night out. Locals love this spot as do tourists.
Make sure you know basic French as the waiters and waitresses do not prefer to
speak English here, nor do they try to.

<h4><a href="http://www.verjusrestaurant.com/">Verjus</a></h4>

Verjus is literally one of the best restaurants in Paris. Situated in a quiet
corner in Paris, you have to find it by going through a small wine celler on the first
floor. Unassuming in appearance, you would never know that once you climb up
the winding stairs, you would enter a michelin star restaurant. The restaurant 
itself serves delectable vegetarian dishes with wine pairings, yet still does 
not feel pretentious at all. What a gem!
