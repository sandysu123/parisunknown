<div class="mainbody">

Drinking coffee is a favorite past time for any Parisian, 
especially cafes that serve bread & delectable pastries! Also, what better places to sip cafe au lait
than great locations where you can people watch all day?

<h4><a href="https://cafedeflore.fr">Cafe de Flore</a></h4>

Cafe de Flore is Ernest Hemingway's old haunt. Located in the 
picturesque St. Germain neighborhood, it is no wonder that
Hemingway would love this spot. He would sit outside,
people watch, eat, and drink coffee, all the while looking for inspiration
for his next book. A surprising quirk is that there is a miniature diorama
of the cafe upstairs! It is a bit touristy, but it is too hard to 
pass up visiting one of the favorite spots of our literary greats.

<h4><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d5801101-Reviews-Fragments_Paris-Paris_Ile_de_France.html">Fragments</a></h4>
Fragments cafe is a little off the beaten path. It is located on a 
quiet street with conspicuous, navy blue facade. You will never see the outside
of the cafe without a rack of coloful bikes. Upon entering, it is
a rustic paradise with wooden tables, chairs, and a small courtyard
in the back.

<h4><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d9785278-Reviews-Boot_Cafe-Paris_Ile_de_France.html">Boot Cafe</a></h4>

Boot Cafe is a cute cafe that is covered in light blue paint. The smell of baked cookies and fresh flowers
permeate this spot. Lots of locals gather here in the morning for their coffee. Many people park their 
bike outside. There is some outdoor seating and when the weather is nice, everyone congregates outside to
chat and catch up.
