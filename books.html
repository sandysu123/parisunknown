What better to do on a Parisian afternoon than stroll into quirky book stores filled with 
vintage texts, rare magazines, or French language books? Why not? These make great conversation
starters!

Comme un Roman is a lovely bookstore that features thousands of French books on culture, travel, art, theater,
and anything creative you can imagine. Great bookstore to visit and learn about French and Parisian culture. It is
definitely worth an afternoon browsing!

An English bookstore in Paris!?! Yes, this is a popular bookstore near Notre Dame. This is also a used bookstore, so you can
find books that are cheap. There are also community events that happen here such as guest speakers or poetry slams.

<h4><a href="https://abbeybookshop.wordpress.com/about/">Abbey Bookshop</a></h4>

A quirky bookshop with used and new magazines, books for the train, essays,
and really anything you desire. The cozy atmosphere with walls of reading
treasures remains a favorite of the locals. They also organize events such as
hiking and parties! This isn't just a bookstore, it's a community! If you
are traveling to Paris, I encourage you to visit this shop and participate in 
some of the events!
