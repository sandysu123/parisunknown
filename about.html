Bon Jour! </p>

<p>
    Welcome to my website! I have been to Paris twice in my life.
    The first time I went to Paris, I visited all the touristy locations.
    Yes, I waited on the long lines of the Eiffel Tower and waded through
    the ridiculous level of crowds just to see the tiny little Mona Lisa by 
    Leonardo da Vinci. Forget about how lost I was trying to get <em>out</em>
    of La Louve!
    </p>
    <p>
    The second time I went to Paris, it was much more relaxed. After getting 
    all the tourist stuff out of the way, I was able to <strong>explore</strong> and
    <strong>live Paris</strong>. I discovered so many hidden gems in the city
    and when I came home, I couldn't wait to tell my friends and family all about it!
      </p>
    
<p>

I created these travel guides from my travels in Paris. I hope that you can also 
benefit from these curated spots and hidden gems. This isn't where the masses of
tourists go. This is where you might find the best baguette or the tastiest macaroons, 
hanging with the locals.
</p>
<p> Bon Voyage!</p>
