<h4><a href="https://en.parisinfo.com/transport/73130/Avenue-des-Champs-Elysees">Champ Elysees</a></h4>

Champ Elysees is where all the major shopping takes place. You can find all
the designer brands here from Chanel to Prada to Louis Vuitton. Visit some of 
the lesser known Parisian designers that give you the au courant French look,
without having to break the bank. These designers are Repetto, Carel, Sandro,
and more! Make sure you bring your passport as they cannot give you a tax refund if
you do not bring it!

What is more Parisian than shopping for flowers? Paris is known for their
excellent skills in creating the most beautiful bouquets. One of my favorite
shops in Paris is a simple one named, Flower. Located in the hip, St. Germain, you 
will become mesmerized by this beautiful shop upon entry. Floor to ceiling
flowers decorate this store! Plus, the florists are passionate and helpful!

<h4><a href="http://www.lesmerveillesdebabellou.com/en/">Les Merveilles de Babellou</a></h4>

Paris is known for its ultra high end shopping, but what about its equally, fun sister: vintage shopping? 
In Les Merveilles de Babellou, you will find anything from vintage rare Chanel
pieces to clothing from the 1920s. This store is so fun and there is something 
for everyone. Return home with a vintage Chanel bag for half the price! Celebrities
are also known to frequent this store and you may spot a famous actress browsing!
